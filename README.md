# Predicting Census Area Typologies Using Deep Learning solutions

**Abstract:**

This research proposed an innovative workflow for validating and classifying ISTAT census areas, addressing the limitations of outdated land-use classifications through a combination of geospatial data validation and deep learning techniques. The study explored two complementary approaches: 1) Google Maps Places API Validation, which was leveraged to cross-check ISTAT’s classifications against real-world points of interest (POIs), effective for structured land-use categories but limited in validating ambiguous ones; and 2) Deep Learning-Based Classification, employing ResNet-50 (CNN) and ViT-Base-Patch16-224 (Vision Transformer) models fine-tuned using high-resolution satellite imagery, with GPT-4o-assisted re-labeling to ensure accurate training data. Results showed ViT-Base-Patch16-224 outperformed ResNet-50, demonstrating superior capability in capturing global spatial relationships. The research highlights the potential of a hybrid approach for continuous and automated updates of ISTAT’s census classifications, with practical applications in real estate, urban planning, and geographic analysis.
